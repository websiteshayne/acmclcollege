                    <h4>Women in STEM</h4>
                    <p>As well as encouraging more students to choose a STEM degree, universities, employers, and governments have also introduced policies aimed at increasing the proportion of women choosing to study in these areas. STEM subjects, historically, have been very male-dominated, with young girls often discouraged from pursuing such a technical career path. While 12% of women in bachelor's programs will graduate with a STEM degree each year, only 3% go on to work in the STEM field. This lack of gender balance has also led to a pay gap between men and women in STEM. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the gender pay gap in STEM fields in Australia was 30.1% in 2013.
                        To combat this, government and charitable initiatives have been launched to increase the number of young women studying STEM degrees and going on to work in STEM-related fields. Girls Who Code, Engineer Girl, Kode With Klossy, and many other organizations have been established to encourage female participation in STEM subjects, with internships and other work placements often made available specifically for young women.</p>

                    <p>STEM gives curious students the skills to tackle problems confidently, facilitates a more positive feeling about learning and greater self-confidence in students, and diffuses negative biases that contribute to the growth of individuals who are curious, confident, and take the initiative when dealing with challenges.</p>

                    <h4>STEM Education</h4>
                    <p>The term STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) is progressively becoming an important fixture in education and the world economy. The reason for this is that the careers of the future will most certainly be centered around STEM fields while also invoking 21st-century skills such as critical thinking, creativity, cultural awareness, collaboration, and problem-solving. When done well, STEM education complements the development of 21st-century skills.
                        While STEM education is important, it is insufficient on its own. To effectively redesign our future, we must integrate sustainability and environmental education into STEM education. We are responsible for ensuring that our current actions are sustainable and that we are progressing towards a better future for future generations. A practical approach to achieving this is through STEM-based sustainability education guided by the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These 17 goals offer direction for STEM education in addressing global challenges, including poverty, inequality, and climate change.
                        Hence, many teachers are starting to integrate STEM into their lessons. But what are the benefits for kids?
                        1. Improves creativity
                        2. Increases team collaboration
                        3. Develops communication skills
                        4. Empowers critical thinking skills

                    <h4>The Future of STEM education</h4>
                    <p>The foundation for a strong STEM education system is intrinsically tied to scientific and technological advancement. STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education applies real world lessons to the classrooms so students can make the connections to the world they’re in. Countries with leading STEM graduates, also have helped shaped the world we all live in; the software we use for work, apps on our phones to communicate with each other and devices in our homes. This strengthens the local economy and increases the per capita income.
                        As the work places become automated, mobile internet further cementing a global workforce, the changes we have seen in the last few years, especially during the pandemic will not only continue, but hasten. Businesses looking to profit from new technology as well as countries looking to increase growth and attract investments will continue the emphasis on STEM related fields. As new technology enter into our lives, there needs to be a strong transition from education to the workplace.</p>

                    <h4>Consequences of Not Investing in STEM</h4>
                    <p>There is already evidence of what happens when STEM in not properly invested in. The Philippines suffers from poor performance of start-ups, low spending on education and publications and shortage of innovation. According to the US National Science Board’s Science and Engineering Indicators, employees in science and engineering fields have grown at an annual rate of 3% between 1960 up to 2013, in comparison to the 2% overall growth of the total workforce. With workers in STEM related fields earning more than double the median salary of other industries, with currently more demand, and job security as companies become digital, not investing in STEM could severely hurt future generations’ ability to not only become competitive in a global economy, but the ability to earn. A focus group by Department of Science and Technology (DoST) showed that although grade school students had positive attitudes of STEM, many were able to only recall terms taught to them, having difficulty in absorbing scientific concepts, and using them in creative and innovative ways. The PIDS research mentions that the Philippines needs additional scientific and technical personnel to produce more graduates. The authors cited data from the Commission on Higher Education (CHEd) that show a declining trend in the number of STEM teachers over the years. The quality of education directly affects students’ ability to learn and apply concepts essential for STEM.
                        The consequences for not deeply investing in STEM though may not be seen for years however, though early signs have been here for some time. Many start-ups are being found in neighboring countries, such as China, India, Japan and even Russia. With well known start-ups such as Tik Tok, Alibaba and Wish, it is no surprise that China leads the world in STEM graduates. India shows a strong second, leading with many IT consulting services, FinTech and software applications. So how can the Philippines compete? Do we even want to compete? According to the World Economic Forum, that leverage interpersonal human skills are on the rise. Occupations such as psychology, education, performing arts, economics, and finance all seem to be on the rise and potential emerging fields for non-STEM related fields. Many of these fields however, may require advanced education. As we head towards 4IR (4TH Industrial Revolution), it will yet to be seen if these industries will remain as competitive as STEM related industries.</p>

                    <h4>Why is STEM important?</h4>
                    <p>STEM education gives people skills that make them more employable and ready to meet the current labor demand. It encompasses a whole range of experiences and skills. Each STEM component makes a valuable contribution to a well-rounded education. Science gives learners an in-depth understanding of the world around them. It helps them become better at research and critical thinking. Technology prepares young people to work in an environment full of high-tech innovations. Engineering allows students to enhance their problem-solving skills and apply their knowledge to new projects. Mathematics enables people to analyze information, eliminate errors, and make conscious decisions when designing solutions. STEM education links these disciplines into a cohesive system. Thus, it prepares professionals who can transform society with innovation and sustainable solutions. STEM subjects are focused on providing solutions to the concerns society has today. Human history has seen years of thoughtless exhaustion of natural resources. Such a lack of environmental education led to numerous challenges. These issues affect the health and well-being of all living organisms on our planet. Our environment needs protection. Thus, sustainability became one of the most urgent aspects studied by STEM disciplines.</p>
